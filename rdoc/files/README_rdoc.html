<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>
Ruby BlackBag (rbkb)
</p>
<p>
A miscellaneous collection of command-line tools and ruby library helpers
related to pen-testing and reversing.
</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<pre>
    Disclaimer:
    Most of what's in the black bag came from a desire to do less typing.
    But there might be a few clever things that were added by accident.
</pre>
<p>
rbkb is inspired by Matasano BlackBag (a set of similar tools written in
C).
</p>
<p>
See: blackbag - <a
href="http://github.com/emonti/rbkb/raw/master/reference/blackbag-0.9.1.tgz">github.com/emonti/rbkb/raw/master/reference/blackbag-0.9.1.tgz</a>
</p>
<p>
Things go into the black bag as they are stolen (as a compliment!) or
dreamed up, usually for simplifying some repetetive task or a desire for a
new tool.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, some of tools in the blackbag spirit make their way into
&#8216;rbkb&#8217; that may or may not make it to &#8216;bkb&#8217; right
away (if ever). Similarly some of the things in &#8216;bkb&#8217; have not
yet made it to &#8216;rbkb&#8217; (and may not).
</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS:</h2>
<h3>Command Line Tools</h3>
<p>
The tools almost all support &#8217;-h&#8217;, but I&#8216;ll admit this
only goes so far. See cli_usage.rdoc for usage and a bit of extra info on
the various tools.
</p>
<p>
When I get some spare time, I&#8216;ll try and do up some examples of using
all the tools.
</p>
<h3><a href="../classes/Plug.html">Plug</a></h3>
<p>
Black Bag includes several tools for testing network protocols using
plugboard proxies. Users of the original Matasano BlackBag may be familiar
with the commands &#8216;bkb replug&#8217;, &#8216;bkb telson&#8217;, and
&#8216;bkb blit&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
Ruby BlackBag has a similar set of network tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8216;blit&#8217; : Uses a simple homegrown OOB IPC mechanism (local
socket) to communicate with &#8216;blit-capable&#8217; tools like telson
and plugsrv and send data to network endpoints through them. Use
&#8216;blit&#8217; to send raw messages to servers or clients then watch
how they respond (see below).

</li>
<li>&#8216;telson&#8217; : Similar to &#8216;bkb telson&#8217;. Opens a TCP or
UDP client connection which is little more than a receiver for
&#8216;blit&#8217; messages. Use this to pretend to be a client and send
raw messages to some service while observing raw replies.

</li>
<li>&#8216;plugsrv&#8217; : Similar to &#8216;bkb replug&#8217;. Sits as a
reverse TCP proxy between one or more clients and a server. Accepts
&#8216;blit&#8217; messages which can be directed at client or server ends
of a conversation. The original &#8216;replug&#8217; didn&#8216;t do this,
which makes plugsrv kindof neat.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monkey Patches</h3>
<p>
Much of rbkb is implemented as a bunch of monkeypatches to <a
href="../classes/Array.html">Array</a>, <a
href="../classes/String.html">String</a>, <a
href="../classes/Numeric.html">Numeric</a> and other base classes. If this
suits your fancy (some people despise monkeypatches, this is not their
fancy) then you can &#8216;require &quot;rbkb&quot;&#8217; from your irb
sessions and own scripts. See &#8216;lib_usage.rdoc&#8217; for more info.
</p>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>eventmachine &gt;= 0.12.8

</li>
</ul>
<h2>INSTALL:</h2>
<h3>Gem Installation</h3>
<p>
rbkb is available as a gem on gemcutter.org:
</p>
<pre>
    gem install rbkb --source http://gemcutter.org
</pre>
<h4>Gem Install Note</h4>
<p>
Installing the gem as root may be risky depending on your rubygems
configuration so I don&#8216;t really recommend using &#8216;sudo gem
install&#8217;. Worst case scenario I know of is I blew away my OSX-shipped
&#8217;/usr/bin/crc32&#8217; this way. It was written in perl, so I
considered this providence and didn&#8216;t look back. But you may feel
differently about &#8216;rubygems&#8217; clobbering a file in /usr/bin.
</p>
<p>
When installing as a regular user, however, rubygems may stick rbkb&#8216;s
executable bin/* files somewhere unexpected. To find out where these are
and either add them to your PATH or copy/symlink them somewhere else like
/usr/local/bin/ do this:
</p>
<pre>
    gem contents rbkb
</pre>
<h3>Manual installation:</h3>
<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/emonti/rbkb.git
  cd rbkb
  rake gem:install
</pre>
<p>
or &#8230; you can also install manually without rubygems.
</p>
<p>
You can access the rbkb project at github. You&#8216;ll want git installed:
</p>
<pre>
  cp -r rbkb/lib/* /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/site_ruby/1.8 # or another ruby libdir
  cp bin/* ~/bin      # or wherever else in your PATH
</pre>
<p>
Run this to generate docs with rdoc the same way the gem would have:
</p>
<pre>
  rake doc:rdoc
</pre>
