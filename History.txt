== 0.6.7
* Enhancements
  * Http::Parameters was given the same treatement as headers got in 0.6.6. 
    Technically params are supposed to be unique, but we try to stay flexible 
    in Rbkb. 
* Bug-fix:
  * Fixed a silly typing bug in Http::Parameters.set_param introduced
    around 0.6.6

  * Http library improperly made headers unique by name. The library has
    been changed so that headers no longer tries to pretend to be a hash.
